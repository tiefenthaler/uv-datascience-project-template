# Autoencoder

The LitAutoEncoder is a PyTorch Lightning module designed for unsupervised learning tasks. It consists of an encoder and a decoder network.

## Key Features

- **Encoder**: Compresses input data into a latent representation.
- **Decoder**: Reconstructs the input data from the latent representation.
- **Loss Function**: Mean Squared Error (MSE) is used to measure reconstruction quality.
