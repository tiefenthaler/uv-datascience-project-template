# Source Code API Reference Overview

Welcome to the **API Reference** section of the UV Data Science Project Template. This section provides detailed documentation for the core components of the project, including the autoencoder, training scripts, and FastAPI application.

## API Documentation

- **[Autoencoder](./autoencoder.md)**: Learn about the implementation of the autoencoder model, including its architecture and usage.
- **[Training](./training.md)**: Explore the training scripts and how to train the autoencoder on the MNIST dataset.
- **[FastAPI Application](./fastapi_app.md)**: Understand how the FastAPI application integrates with the autoencoder to provide an API for model interaction.

## How to Use the API

1. **Navigate to the API Documentation**: Use the links above to access detailed information about each component.
2. **Run the FastAPI Application**: Follow the instructions in the [FastAPI Guide](../guides/docker_vscode_devcontainer.md) to start the application.
3. **Test the Endpoints**: Use tools like `curl` or Postman to interact with the API endpoints.
