## Why Use the UV Data Science Project Template?

The UV Data Science Project Template is built to address common challenges in data science projects. It provides a structured environment that ensures your projects are:

- **Reproducible**: Leveraging Docker and UV, the template creates isolated and consistent environments, eliminating the "it works on my machine" problem.
- **Collaborative**: Pre-configured CI/CD pipelines and documentation tools make teamwork seamless and efficient.
- **Scalable**: With production-ready configurations, transitioning from development to deployment is effortless.

By adopting this template, you can focus on solving data problems instead of wrestling with setup and configuration.

## Tools Integrated into the Template

The UV Data Science Project Template incorporates a suite of powerful tools, each carefully chosen to address specific aspects of data science workflows. Here’s a closer look:

### 1. **UV**

UV is a fast Python package and project manager written in Rust. It replaces tools like pip, poetry, and virtualenv, offering:

- **Dependency Management**: Ensures efficient and consistent installation of dependencies.
- **Virtual Environment Creation**: Prevents dependency conflicts by isolating environments.
- **Project Packaging**: Simplifies the distribution of Python projects.
- **Usage**: Manage dependencies, run scripts, and handle virtual environments with commands like `uv run pytest` for tests or `uv add` to install new packages.

### 2. **Ruff**

Ruff is an ultra-fast Python linter and formatter written in Rust. It ensures code quality and consistency by enforcing coding standards.

- **Linting and Formatting**: Identifies stylistic errors, potential bugs, and ensures adherence to standards.
- **Pre-Commit Integration**: Automatically lints and formats code before commits.
- **Usage**: Run `uv run ruff check .` to lint the codebase or `uv run ruff format .` to format it.

### 3. **Pyright**

Pyright is a static type checker for Python, helping to catch type-related errors early in development.

- **Type Checking**: Ensures correct type annotations for functions and variables.
- **Usage**: Integrated into the CI pipeline and can be run locally using `uv run pyright`.

### 4. **Pytest and Coverage**

Pytest and Coverage.py ensure your code is reliable and well-tested.

- **Testing**: Write and execute unit tests with Pytest.
- **Code Coverage**: Identify untested parts of the code with Coverage.py.
- **Usage**: Run `uv run pytest --cov` to execute tests and generate a coverage report.

### 5. **MkDocs**

MkDocs is a static site generator for creating professional project documentation.

- **Documentation Generation**: Converts Markdown files into a static website.
- **Plugins**: Includes `mkdocstrings` for API documentation and `mkdocs-material` for a modern theme.
- **Usage**: Store documentation in the `docs` folder and preview it locally with `uv run mkdocs serve`.

### 6. **Docker**

Docker ensures consistent environments for development and production.

- **Development**: Use `docker-compose.yml` to set up a containerized environment.
- **Production**: Create lean and secure production images with `multistage.Dockerfile`.
- **Usage**: Build and run the application in a container using `docker-compose up --build`.

### 7. **GitHub Actions**

GitHub Actions automates CI/CD workflows, streamlining development.

- **CI/CD Pipelines**: Automates tasks like linting, testing, and deploying documentation.
- **Usage**: Every push or pull request triggers the CI pipeline to run tests and checks.

### 8. **Pre-Commit Hooks**

Pre-commit hooks enforce code quality by running checks before commits.

- **Automated Checks**: Includes linting, formatting, and type checking.
- **Usage**: Install hooks with `uv run pre-commit install` and run them manually using `uv run pre-commit run --all-files`.

## Machine Learning Use Case: Autoencoder for Image Compression

To demonstrate its capabilities, the template includes a machine learning use case featuring an autoencoder implemented with PyTorch Lightning.

### Objective

The autoencoder compresses and reconstructs images, showcasing its ability to learn efficient data representations.

### Dataset

The project uses the MNIST dataset, a collection of handwritten digits commonly used in machine learning experiments.

### Implementation

- The `LitAutoEncoder` class defines the encoder and decoder networks.
- The `train_litautoencoder` function trains the model on the MNIST dataset.

### FastAPI Integration

The project includes a FastAPI application to serve the trained model. Endpoints allow users to train the model and generate embeddings for new data.
